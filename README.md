Chronologist is a Kubernetes controller that syncs your Helm chart deployments 
with Grafana annotations.

Key features:

- For each Helm release you install/upgrade creates related Grafana annotation
- Annotations are tagged with related info such as release name, release namespace, etc
- When you purge delete a release, deletes corresponding annotation
